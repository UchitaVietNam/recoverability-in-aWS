For a Multi-AZ, multi-region database deployment, the achievable Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) are contingent on various factors such as the complexity of the database, network latency, and the specific database technology in use.
Below is a general assessment:

1. Minimum RTO for a Single AZ Outage:
   - RTO for a single Availability Zone (AZ) outage can be quite low, typically in the order of seconds to minutes. This is because Multi-AZ configurations provide automatic failover to standby replicas within the same region. The failover process involves promoting a read replica to the primary instance, which is a relatively quick operation. However, the exact RTO depends on factors like database size and the time required for DNS propagation.

2. Minimum RTO for a Single Region Outage:
   - RTO for a single region outage is typically higher compared to a single AZ outage. While the failover within the same region is fast, cross-region failover involves more complexity due to the longer distances, potential network latency, and synchronization of data between regions. RTO for a single region outage can range from several minutes to hours, depending on the database technology, data volume, and the readiness of standby instances in the target region.

3. Minimum RPO for a Single AZ Outage:
   - RPO for a single AZ outage can be quite low, often measured in seconds or less. This is because Multi-AZ configurations ensure synchronous replication of data to a standby replica within the same region. Data is simultaneously written to the primary and secondary instances, minimizing data loss in the event of an AZ failure.

4. Minimum RPO for a Single Region Outage:
   - RPO for a single region outage is typically higher compared to a single AZ outage. Cross-region replication involves asynchronous data replication, which introduces a delay in data synchronization between regions. RPO can range from seconds to minutes, depending on the database technology and the frequency of replication. To minimize RPO, organizations might implement solutions like active-active configurations with synchronous replication between regions, but these can be more complex and costly.

Note : It's essential to note that achieving these objectives requires careful planning, architecture, and continuous testing to ensure that the database failover and recovery processes meet the desired RTO and RPO targets. Additionally, specific database technologies and configurations can impact these objectives, so organizations should tailor their strategies to their unique requirements and constraints.
